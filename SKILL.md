description: Use the lwchat CLI to read and act on Google Chat — find/read/reply on Redmine issue threads, post generic messages to spaces, DM users, and search across spaces. Activates when the user asks about chat discussions, thread context, sending Chat messages, DMing someone, or searching the team's Chat history.

# lwchat — Google Chat CLI for AI agents

`lwchat` is the Chat side of your toolset. Two complementary surfaces:

- **Redmine bridge** — `find`/`read`/`reply` jump from an issue ID to the thread(s) discussing it. Built around the convention that the thread-starter contains the issue URL.
- **Generic Chat** — `post`/`dm`/`search`/`threads` work on any space, thread, or person — no issue ID required.

Every command takes `--json` and emits a stable shape — **always parse JSON, never pretty output.**

## Deeper documentation (when you need it)

This file is the operational contract. For background:

- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** in the repo — module map, data-dir layout, cache mechanics, mention engine, OAuth flow.
- **`docs/DECISIONS.md`** — ADRs covering every consequential design choice (multi-space safety, no JS plugins, why a fork instead of a runtime overlay, scope minimalism, naming).
- **`docs/ROADMAP.md`** — what's done, what's next, the frozen-core + Linways-fork publishing plan, known limits.
- **`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`** — how to add a command without breaking conventions.
- **`recipes/`** — composable patterns (`gather-context`, `reply-patterns`, `generic-chat`).

## ⚡ Read this first — your spaces context

Before answering anything about chat discussions, threads, or spaces, **read `~/.lwchat/me.md`**. It tells you:

- The authenticated user's identity (name, email, Chat user ID).
- The **configured spaces** (alias → space ID) that `find`/`read`/`reply` search by default.
- The **full list of spaces** the user belongs to, with member counts and last-active dates — the closed set to match against when the user names a space loosely ("the exam controller space").

If `~/.lwchat/me.md` doesn't exist, the user isn't set up yet. Run `lwchat me --refresh` (requires auth) to generate it, or see Setup below.

---

## Setup

`lwchat` is a standalone Node.js CLI with zero npm dependencies. It manages its own OAuth2 tokens and stores everything under `~/.lwchat/`.

**Install** (from the cloned repo):
```bash
node install.mjs install
```
This links the `lwchat` binary, snapshots this skill to `~/.lwchat/skill/`, symlinks it into detected AI tools, and grants Claude Code `Read(~/.lwchat/**)`.

**Authenticate** — the user runs this, not you (it opens a browser for sign-in + consent):
> `lwchat auth login`

That uses the bundled Linways Workspace OAuth client — no flags needed for normal use. Power users with their own Cloud project pass `--client-id <id> --client-secret <secret>`; existing `gws` users can pass `--import-gws` to reuse those credentials.

After login, `lwchat` auto-generates `~/.lwchat/me.md` and auto-configures spaces. Verify with `lwchat auth status` or the full `lwchat doctor`.

**Installer lifecycle** (`node install.mjs <cmd>`): `install`, `update` (code + skill), `install-skill` / `update-skill` (skills only), `status` (what's installed where), `uninstall` (removes links + npm unlink, preserves `~/.lwchat` data).

## Commands

### Health check (doctor)

```bash
lwchat doctor          # runtime self-test: config, auth, network, me.md
lwchat doctor --json   # machine-readable; exits non-zero if any check fails
```

Run this first when something isn't working — it pinpoints whether the problem is auth, config, network, or a stale `me.md`.

### Show your context (me.md)

```bash
lwchat me              # print ~/.lwchat/me.md (generates if missing)
lwchat me --refresh    # re-fetch identity + spaces, rewrite me.md
```

### Find the chat thread(s) for an issue

```bash
lwchat find <issue_id> [--json]
```

Reports **every** space the issue's thread appears in (the same issue is often cross-posted to multiple spaces). `--json` returns `{ ok, issue_id, count, locations: [{ space_alias, thread, ... }] }`. Locations are cached in `~/.lwchat/cache/thread-index.json`.

### Read thread discussion

```bash
lwchat read <issue_id> [--space <alias>] [--json]
```

Returns messages chronologically, sender IDs resolved to names. If the issue is in **one** space, reads it. If in **multiple**, reads them all unless you pass `--space <alias>` to pick one. Messages are **always fetched live** — the cache only stores the thread location, never message content.

**JSON shape** (always a `threads` array, one per matching space):
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "issue_id": "126270",
  "count": 1,
  "threads": [
    {
      "space_alias": "exam-controller",
      "thread": "spaces/AAAAdOaHhRY/threads/j7YSIlbB5jc",
      "message_count": 5,
      "messages": [
        {
          "sender": "users/117334358123398955954",
          "sender_name": "Muhammed Rameez",
          "sender_type": "HUMAN",
          "text": "the actual message text",
          "created": "2026-05-25T07:43:57.913327Z",
          "is_reply": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Reply to a thread

```bash
lwchat reply <issue_id> "<message>" [--space <alias>] [--json]
```

Posts a threaded reply. **@mentions are auto-resolved** — write `@Krishnakumar` or `@Ranjith Balachandran` and lwchat converts the name to the proper `<users/ID>` mention syntax (first name or full name; `@all` mentions everyone). The resolved text is shown before sending.

**Multi-space safety:** if the issue exists in more than one space, `reply` **refuses to post** without `--space <alias>` (so a message never lands in the wrong space). `find` first to see the options.

**Use cases:**
- Status update: `lwchat reply 126270 "#prod_release — deployed to production @Ranjith"`
- Targeted: `lwchat reply 126270 "verified" --space exam-controller`

> Never reply on the user's behalf without explicit permission. Show what will be posted first.

### Post a message to a space (non-Redmine)

```bash
lwchat post <space> "<message>"                       # new top-level message (new thread)
lwchat post <space> "<message>" --thread <thread_name> # reply to any thread (Redmine or not)
lwchat post <space> "<message>" --json                 # machine output
```

`<space>` accepts a configured alias (`exam-controller`) or a raw `spaces/<id>`. With `--thread`, the message goes as a threaded reply to the named thread (use this when you have a thread name from `threads --json` or `search --json` and the thread isn't tied to a Redmine issue).

**JSON shape:**
```json
{ "ok": true, "space": "spaces/...", "space_alias": "myspace",
  "thread": "spaces/.../threads/...", "message_name": "spaces/.../messages/...",
  "resolved_text": "the posted text after @mention resolution" }
```

@mentions are resolved across **all** cached spaces' member maps (since `post` isn't scoped to one space's roster).

### Direct message a person

```bash
lwchat dm <user> "<message>"   # user = email, full name, or users/<id>
```

Resolution order (most specific first):

1. `users/<id>` → used as-is
2. anything with `@` → treated as an email (`users/<email>`)
3. **Directory API search** (org-wide) — finds anyone at the user's Workspace org by name, even people who share no space with you and were never @mentioned. Single exact match wins; multiple matches throw an ambiguity error listing the candidates.
4. Aggregated annotation cache — fallback for users not in the org directory (e.g. Chat apps, external members)

If the recipient has no existing DM space with the user, **lwchat creates one** via `spaces.setup` (requires the `chat.memberships` write scope, granted in v0.1.2 — see ADR-013). No "open Chat first" friction.

### Org directory lookup

```bash
lwchat directory <query>             # human output (uses 7-day cache after first lookup)
lwchat directory <query> --refresh   # bypass cache, hit People API live
lwchat directory <query> --json      # { ok, query, count, from_cache, results: [{name, email, userId}] }
```

Search the user's Workspace directory for matching people. Returns `name`, `email`, and `users/<id>`. Independent of which spaces you're in. Results are cached 7 days so a repeat lookup is instant.

### Cache warming

`auth login` auto-pre-warms every configured space's member roster (parallel, ~1-2s) so the **first** command after login runs cache-hot. To re-warm anytime (after adding a space, after a colleague joins, after `cache clear`):

```bash
lwchat warm           # human output: "done · X member(s) across Y space(s) in Zs"
lwchat warm --json    # { ok, spaces, warmed, failed, total_members, duration_ms }
```

Both `members.json` and the `directory_cache` carry a 7-day TTL — member lists rarely change at most teams. `lwchat cache show` lists all three cache sections (thread / members / directory) with per-entry age.

### Search messages

```bash
lwchat search <term>                                    # scan default_spaces
lwchat search <term> --space exam-controller            # one space
lwchat search <term> --spaces exam-controller,cicd      # comma-separated subset
lwchat search <term> --limit 50                         # default 30
lwchat search <term> --case-sensitive                   # default is case-insensitive substring
lwchat search <term> --json                             # structured
```

Google Chat has **no server-side full-text search**, so this is a bounded client-side scan (the same pagination `find`/`index` use, capped by `page_limit`). Returns per match: `space_alias`, `thread`, `sender_name`, `created`, and a snippet. Results are capped by `--limit`; if the cap is hit, the human output says so.

**JSON shape:**
```json
{ "ok": true, "term": "...", "scope": ["exam-controller"], "count": 3, "limit": 30,
  "results": [{ "space_alias": "exam-controller", "thread": "spaces/.../threads/...",
                 "sender_name": "Lakshmi Nandakumar", "created": "2026-05-23T08:01:24.128703Z",
                 "snippet": "...", "is_reply": false }] }
```

Combine with `post --thread` to take action on a thread you found via `search`:
```bash
THREAD=$(lwchat search "folio bug" --json | jq -r '.results[0].thread')
SPACE=$(lwchat search "folio bug" --json | jq -r '.results[0].space_alias')
lwchat post "$SPACE" "any update on this?" --thread "$THREAD"
```

### Cache

```bash
lwchat cache show     # list cached issues, their spaces, and freshness
lwchat cache clear    # drop the thread location cache
```

The cache stores only **thread locations** (stable IDs), never messages. Within `cache_ttl_seconds` (default 300s) `find`/`read`/`reply` use it instantly; past the TTL they re-scan to catch a thread newly posted to another space, falling back to the cached location if the scan fails.

### List recent threads

```bash
lwchat threads [--space <alias>] [--json]
```

Lists recent threads with first messages. With `--json`, enriches each thread with Redmine metadata (status, assignee, priority) via `lwr` if it's on PATH.

### Members

```bash
lwchat members [--space <alias>]          # name → user ID
lwchat members refresh [--space <alias>]  # rebuild member cache
```

Member names are extracted from message annotations (no extra OAuth scope needed) and cached 24h in `~/.lwchat/cache/members.json`.

### Build/refresh the thread index

```bash
lwchat index [--space <alias>]
```

Bulk-scans spaces to warm the issue→thread cache.

### Spaces management

```bash
lwchat spaces                      # list configured spaces
lwchat spaces fetch                # fetch all spaces from Google Chat
lwchat spaces add <alias> <id>     # configure a space
lwchat spaces remove <alias>
```

### Backup / restore

```bash
lwchat backup [label]       # snapshot config + tokens + me.md + cache
lwchat backup list
lwchat restore [name]       # latest if no name
```

## Data layout (`~/.lwchat/`)

```
~/.lwchat/
  config.json              spaces, default_spaces, redmine_url_pattern, cache_ttl_seconds, page_limit
  tokens.json              OAuth client_id/secret/refresh_token (mode 600)
  me.md                    generated identity + spaces snapshot
  cache/thread-index.json  issue_id → { space_alias → {space, thread, indexed_at} }
  cache/members.json       space → {user_id → name}
  backups/                 timestamped backups
  skill/                   canonical SKILL.md + recipes (managed by install.mjs)
```

`config.json` keys:
- **spaces**: alias → Google Chat space ID
- **default_spaces**: spaces searched when no `--space` is given
- **redmine_url_pattern**: change to match your Redmine instance
- **cache_ttl_seconds**: thread-location cache freshness window (default 300; re-scans after this to catch new cross-posts)
- **page_limit**: max pages scanned per space (100 messages/page)

## Common agent workflows

### Gather full context before working on an issue
```bash
lwr issue view <id> --json     # formal Redmine issue
lwchat read <id> --json       # informal chat discussion
```

### Check what the team discussed
```bash
lwchat read <id> --json | jq '.messages[] | {who: .sender_name, text}'
```

---

## Error handling

With `--json`, errors return `{"ok": false, "error": "message"}`. Exit code 1 = issue not found in any configured space. If `find` fails for a known issue, the space may be unconfigured or older than the scan window — add the space (`lwchat spaces add`) and/or raise `page_limit`.

See `recipes/gather-context.md` and `recipes/reply-patterns.md` for detailed patterns.
