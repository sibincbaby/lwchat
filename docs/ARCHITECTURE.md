## 1. Mental model

lwchat is **a thin CLI over the Google Chat REST API**, with one bridging concept layered on top: a Redmine issue ID maps to one or more Chat thread starters that contain the issue's URL. Everything else — auth, message posting, mention resolution, search, DM, caching — is org-agnostic Google Chat plumbing.

```

Zero npm dependencies, plain ESM JavaScript, Node ≥ 18 stdlib only (`http`, `fs`, `path`, `url`, `child_process`). No build step. No transpiler.

## 2. Data directory: `~/.lwchat/`

The **single source of truth** for runtime state. The cloned repo holds *code*; `~/.lwchat/` holds *your* data. Uninstalling lwchat doesn't touch this directory.

```
~/.lwchat/
├── config.json              ─ spaces, default_spaces, redmine_url_pattern,
│                              cache_ttl_seconds, page_limit
├── tokens.json              ─ OAuth client_id / secret / refresh_token (chmod 0600)
├── me.md                    ─ generated identity + spaces snapshot
│                              (Markdown — agents read this as session context)
├── cache/
│   ├── thread-index.json    ─ issue_id → { space_alias → location }
│   └── members.json         ─ space → { user_id → display_name }
├── backups/                 ─ timestamped snapshots
│   └── 2026-05-29T10-17-01_pre-project-switch/
│       ├── config.json
│       ├── tokens.json
│       ├── me.md
│       ├── thread-index.json
│       ├── members.json
│       └── meta.json
└── skill/                   ─ canonical SKILL.md + recipes
    │                          (managed by install.mjs; symlinked into AI tools)
    ├── SKILL.md
    └── recipes/*.md
```

Every path is a constant in `lib/config.js`. New runtime files belong in this tree, not in the repo.

### `config.json` schema

```jsonc
{
  "spaces": {                                 // alias → space resource name
    "exam-controller": "spaces/AAAAdOaHhRY",
    "myspace":          "spaces/AAAAI_WLIUo"
  },
  "default_spaces": [                          // ordered scan list for find/index/search
    "exam-controller", "academics", "dev-analysis"
  ],
  "redmine_url_pattern": "redmine.linways.com/issues/",
  "cache_ttl_seconds": 300,                    // thread-location cache freshness window
  "page_limit": 20                             // max pages scanned per space (100 msgs/pg)
}
```

Default values live in `DEFAULT_CONFIG` (`lib/config.js`). Missing keys fall back to defaults at read time — adding a new config key is non-breaking for existing installs.

## 3. The thread-location cache (the most subtle piece)

`cache/thread-index.json` maps each Redmine issue ID to **every space the issue's thread appears in**. This is the load-bearing data structure for `find`/`read`/`reply`.

### Shape

```jsonc
{
  "126235": {                                       // ← issue id
    "exam-controller": {                            // ← space alias
      "space":         "spaces/AAAAdOaHhRY",
      "thread":        "spaces/AAAAdOaHhRY/threads/a8PR5cEXXjg",
      "space_alias":   "exam-controller",
      "first_message": "Christ ijk - Bug - Subject Not Listing...",
      "indexed_at":    "2026-05-29T06:11:56.939Z"
    },
    "dev-analysis": { ... }                         // ← issue cross-posted to a 2nd space
  }
}
```

### What is NOT stored

**No message content.** The cache holds only the *location* of a thread (stable resource ID). `read` always paginates the live API to fetch the actual messages — so the cache cannot serve stale conversation text. This is the answer to "is my cache going to give me old messages?": no, it physically can't.

### TTL + stale-but-usable fallback (`lib/commands.js` → `resolveLocations`)

```
cached entry exists?
  ├─ no   → live scan; cache the result; return
  └─ yes  → newest indexed_at within cache_ttl_seconds?
              ├─ yes → return cached (no network, instant)
              └─ no  → live re-scan to refresh and catch newly-cross-posted spaces
                       ├─ scan succeeded → merge cached + scanned (scanned wins overlap)
                       └─ scan failed (network)
                                        → return cached anyway (thread IDs are stable)
```

The TTL exists to **catch a thread newly posted to another space**, not to invalidate location data. Stale cache is always a safe fallback — Chat thread IDs do not change once created.

`lwchat cache show` / `lwchat cache clear` expose the cache to users.

## 4. Multi-space safety

Because the same issue can be cross-posted to multiple spaces (a real situation in our setup), every read/write path must be multi-space aware:

| Command | Multi-space behaviour |
|---|---|
| `find` | reports **every** space, prints them all |
| `read` | reads **all matching threads** by default; `--space <alias>` narrows to one |
| `reply` | with 1 location → posts; with **>1 and no `--space`** → **refuses** with a clear error listing the available spaces (so a reply never lands in the wrong thread) |
| `index` | accumulates per-(issue, space) entries; never overwrites a sibling location |

The reply safety check happens *before* any `sendMessage` API call. There is no "we'll pick one for you" branch — that would be a footgun.

## 5. Mention resolution

`lib/chat-api.js` → `resolveMentions(text, memberMap)`.

Google Chat's API needs `<users/<id>>` syntax for real mentions; literal `@Name` is treated as plain text and does **not** notify the person. lwchat fills the gap.

### How the member map is built

We bypass the official `spaces.members.list` (which **does not** return display names for user-OAuth callers — only `users/<id>`) and instead harvest names from existing message **annotations**:

- `paginateMessages(space)` over the last few pages
- For each `m.annotations[]` whose `type == 'USER_MENTION'`, slice `m.argumentText[startIndex : startIndex + length]` — this is the actual rendered name the user typed
- Map `user.name → name` into `~/.lwchat/cache/members.json`

This requires zero extra OAuth scopes and works as long as the person has ever been @mentioned in the space. For people never mentioned, only `users/<id>` is known.

A 24 h TTL applies to `members.json`. `lwchat members refresh` forces a rebuild.

### Resolution policy (text → `<users/<id>>` substitution)

1. `@all` → literal `<users/all>` (Chat's everyone-mention)
2. Try matching 1-, 2-, then 3-word names against the cached full-name map (longer matches win — `@Hamy Paul K` wins over `@Hamy`)
3. Fall back to a first-name lookup. **If the first name is ambiguous across the org, leave the literal text alone** (silent no-op — never pick the wrong person)

For `post` and `dm` the member map used is the **union across every cached space's members.json**, since these commands aren't scoped to a single space's roster.

## 6. The bridge convention (the one org-specific assumption)

`find` doesn't query Redmine. It pattern-matches the *Chat message text*:

```js
extractIssueId(text, pattern) =
  text.match(new RegExp(escapeRegex(pattern) + "(\\d+)"))?.[1] ?? null
```

With `pattern = "redmine.linways.com/issues/"`, this extracts the issue number from any URL like `https://redmine.linways.com/issues/126235`. To make `find` test whether a *specific* issue ID `N` is referenced, we run the extractor on the message and compare strings: `extractIssueId(text, pattern) === String(N)`. This is correct (full-digit capture prevents `1262350` being mistaken for `126235`) and config-driven (changing `redmine_url_pattern` rewires the entire matching path).

`reply` then targets the cached `{space, thread}` and calls `messages.create` with the `thread.name` set — that's the only Redmine-specific code path in the entire tool.

`getIssue()` in `lib/redmine.js` shells to `lwr issue view <id> --json` and is the **only optional integration** — it powers the Redmine-status column in `threads --json` and the `integration.lwr` doctor check. If `lwr` isn't on PATH, it returns `null` and everything keeps working.

## 7. Posting model

```
   sendMessage(space, threadName, text)    →  POST /v1/{space}/messages
                                              body: { text, thread: { name } }

   postToSpace(space, text)                →  POST /v1/{space}/messages
                                              body: { text }                  (no thread → new thread)

   findDirectMessage(userId)               →  GET  /v1/spaces:findDirectMessage
                                              params: { name: users/<id> }
                                              returns existing DM space or null on 404
```

All posting commands resolve `@mentions` via the aggregated member map and pass the resolved text to one of the three primitives above.

### DM v1 limitation

`dm` can only post to an **existing** 1:1 DM space (`findDirectMessage` returns 404 for non-existent DMs). Creating a brand-new DM requires the `chat.memberships` *write* scope, which lwchat doesn't request — adding it would force every user through an extra consent screen on auth. v1 trade-off: error with `"Open a DM in Chat once, then retry"`. v2 may upgrade if the friction becomes annoying.

## 8. Search

`search` is a bounded **client-side scan** — Google Chat's `messages.list` filter parameter only supports `create_time` and `thread.name`, not message content. So:

```
for each chosen space:
  paginate ≤ page_limit pages of 100 msgs each (newest-first):
    for each msg:
      if matches(needle, msg.text):
        record { space, thread, sender, sender_name, created, snippet }
        stop when count == limit
```

Honest about coverage: the human output explicitly says "(limit reached — use --limit to expand)" when it caps, so a user/agent doesn't mistake the cap for "no more matches." Scopes are user-controlled via `--space`, `--spaces a,b,c`, or default to `default_spaces`.

## 9. Authentication

`lib/auth.js` implements a **localhost-loopback OAuth2 flow** (Google's recommended desktop-app flow). The lifecycle:

```
auth login --client-id X --client-secret Y
   │
   ├─ spin up a one-shot HTTP server on a random localhost port
   ├─ open the browser to Google's consent URL with redirect_uri = that port
   ├─ user approves
   ├─ Google redirects to localhost?code=... → handler exchanges code for tokens
   ├─ tokens saved to ~/.lwchat/tokens.json (chmod 0600)
   └─ afterLogin(): generateMe({autoConfig: true}) → writes ~/.lwchat/me.md and
                    auto-aliases every space the user is a member of
```

`requireAuth()` is called before every API request. It reads the refresh token, swaps it for a fresh access token (`POST oauth2/v2/token grant_type=refresh_token`), caches the access token in memory with its `expires_at`, and reuses it until ~30 s before expiry. No re-auth needed between commands.

`--import-gws` is the convenience path: shell out to `gws auth export --unmasked`, snip out the `client_id / client_secret / refresh_token`, and write `tokens.json` directly — useful for engineers who already use the [`gws` CLI](https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli).

### Scopes

```
chat.spaces.readonly        list spaces, list members, list messages, find DMs
chat.messages               post messages (the only write scope)
chat.memberships.readonly   list members (we also use annotations for names)
openid                      basic OIDC subject
userinfo.profile            people/me display name
userinfo.email              people/me email
```

Adding a scope requires a re-auth (Google issues a new refresh token that includes the scope). Doctor's `auth.refresh` check surfaces stale-scope failures clearly.

## 10. The install model

lwchat is **a tool the user installs into their account**, not a service. The install.mjs orchestrates four things:

```
1. npm link              → ./bin/lwchat.js becomes globally invokable as `lwchat`

2. refreshCanonicalSkill → copy repo/SKILL.md → ~/.lwchat/skill/SKILL.md
                           copy repo/recipes/ → ~/.lwchat/skill/recipes/

3. installAllSkills      → for each AI tool that has its parent dotdir
                           (.claude / .codex / .copilot / .gemini/antigravity)
                           symlink {tool}/skills/lwchat/{SKILL.md, recipes}
                           → ~/.lwchat/skill/{SKILL.md, recipes}

4. installClaudePermissions → append Read(~/.lwchat/**) and Bash(lwchat:*)
                              to ~/.claude/settings.json
```

The canonical snapshot lives in `~/.lwchat/skill/`, not in the repo, so:
- Updating the skill (`update-skill`) is a single copy + relink; AI tools auto-see new content.
- Agents running mid-session don't see content change under them — the snapshot only refreshes when install.mjs is re-run.
- Uninstalling cleanly removes symlinks but leaves user data intact (the install.mjs `uninstall` path).

Doctor's `Context` and AI-tool symlink-resolution checks confirm this chain end to end.

## 11. CLI conventions

`bin/lwchat.js` does only three things in order:

1. **Strip global boolean flags** (`--json`, `--verbose`, `--case-sensitive`) so they cannot leak into positional args (real bug from v0 — see CHANGELOG)
2. **Pop value flags** (`--space`, `--thread`, `--spaces`, `--limit`) before computing positional args (so `reply <id> "msg" --space X` works without `--space X` becoming part of the message)
3. **Dispatch** by `cmd` then optional `sub`

Conventions:

- Every command supports `--json` for machine output
- Errors in `--json` mode return `{ "ok": false, "error": "...", "...": "extra context" }`
- Non-zero exit on failure (the doctor check too, so CI can react)
- Pretty mode is for humans; **always parse JSON**, never pretty output

## 12. Module boundaries

| Module | Owns | Touches |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/config.js` | `~/.lwchat` paths; load/save config, tokens, index, members, backups | filesystem only |
| `lib/auth.js` | OAuth2 flow, token refresh, `--import-gws`, `CHAT_SCOPES` | HTTPS to Google's `oauth2.googleapis.com`, `accounts.google.com` |
| `lib/chat-api.js` | API client (`api()` helper), every Chat / People endpoint, mention engine | HTTPS to `chat.googleapis.com`, `people.googleapis.com` |
| `lib/commands.js` | Every command body; the helpers shared between them | All of the above |
| `lib/me.js` | me.md generation + auto-alias on first login | chat-api + config |
| `lib/redmine.js` | Optional `lwr` enrichment + the `extractIssueId` matcher | shells to `lwr` |
| `bin/lwchat.js` | Arg parsing, global-flag stripping, dispatch | commands.js |
| `install.mjs` | Installer / updater / status / uninstall | filesystem, child_process |

When adding a new feature, choose the right module: API plumbing goes in `chat-api.js`; user-facing behaviour in `commands.js`; file paths in `config.js`. See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for the walkthrough.
